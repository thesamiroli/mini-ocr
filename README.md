It can detect English characters/numbers. <br>
Start the gui.py file to start it. <br> The limitation to this is that, it cannot separate characters based on new line changes and spaces. <br>
I have saved two weights of the trained digits dataset. One was trained with 30 epochs and another was trained with 100 epochs. <br>
The character dataset was trained with only 10 epochs. <br> Because the character dataset was significantly larger than the digit dataset, even with 10 epochs, character detection shows higher accuracy. <br>
